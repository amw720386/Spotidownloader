# Spoti Download

A VERY simplistic lightweight Spotify playlist downloader for your android device! 

(This is a personal project for mostly personal use, if someone wants features please inquire in the issues tab)

### What does this do?

It pulls a spotify playlist/album/track given a link, and based on the embed data it searches youtube for relevant music and downloads it for you!


### Features!

- Works with all tracks, albums and playlists
- Returns .m4a files ONLY, which are accessible on most android devices
    - .m4a files work perfectly well with [Oto Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.piyush.music), which has no ads   


### Future Work

- Better UI
- Past Downloads Section
- Share to app directly from Spotify
- Better download handling (right now it downloads to a folder called Music/Spotidownloader-whatever-time-it-is)
